# Hugo launch configuration snippet for VSCode
After searching way to long in the internet I created my own launch.json and tasks.json for hugo:
hugo configuration for vscode using launch.json and tasks.json. Error Detection (Problem matcher) included!

## Usage
copy `launch.json` and `tasks.json` into your `.vscode` folder. 

- Run Task: Press `<cmd>+<shift>+p` select `start server`
- Launch: Select the Run button in your menu bar. **DO NOT USE THE ONE ABOVE YOUR FILE**

## Customize
Feel free to make and push your own modifications.
